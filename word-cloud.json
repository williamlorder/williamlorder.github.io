        "values": ["Background The general aggression model has shown that both individual and situational factors can predict aggression. However, past research has tended to discuss these two factors separately, which might lead to inconsistency. This study addresses this gap by examining the importance of each predictor of aggression in a Chinese compulsory drug treatment population and further explores the predictors of aggression in various substance use disorder populations. Method Analyses were conducted using a sample of 894 male participants (mean = 38.30, SD = 8.38) in Chinese compulsory drug rehab. A machine learning model named LightGBM was employed to make predictions. We then used a game-theoretic explanatory technique, SHAP, to estimate the effect of predictors. Results In the full-sample model, psychological security, parental conflict, and impulsivity were the top 3 predictors. Depression, childhood abuse, and alexithymia positively predicted aggression, whereas psychological security, family cohesion, and gratitude negatively predicted aggression. There were significant differences in the predictive effects of depressants and stimulants. Although the importance of predictors varied between drug-use groups, several individual and situational factors were consistently the most important predictors. Limitations All participants in this study were male, and the data were acquired through self-reports from the participants. Domestic and nondomestic aggression are not distinguished. Additionally, our findings cannot support causal conclusions. Conclusion This study tested a series of classical theories of the predictors of aggression in China's compulsory drug treatment context and extended the ideas of the GAM to various substance use disorder groups. The findings have important implications for aggression treatment.",
        "The traceability of COVID-19 is of great importance for Epidemiological implications. Two robust and non-parametric traceability methods were employed in the study to evaluate COVID-19’s traceability for the prevention of epidemics. We ﬁrst corrected the initial dates for eight countries using Solow and smith’s method, and then the OLE method was applied to the corrected dataset for traceability. Our model suggests that the ﬁrst global case of COVID-19 originated on 25 September 2019 (95%CI 23 September) and that the ﬁrst case emerged in Europe and spread rapidly to neighbouring countries, expanding globally in early January 2021. Our study suggests that the spread of the epidemic may be more rapid and earlier than we thought. The two methods we use can be used in a robust traceability approach for small sample estimates, providing additional explanations for epidemic traceability studies.",
		"Background and Aims: There are no accurate statistical data on the relapse rate of drug abstainers after compulsory detoxification in China. This study aimed to collect relapse data for drug abstainers through follow-up visits, verify the effectiveness of professional social worker services and explore significant factors affecting relapse.Design and Setting: The drug abstainers released from Guangzhou T Compulsory Isolated Detoxification Center were randomly divided into two groups. The difference between the experimental group and the control group is that assistance services were provided by social workers to the former.Participants: The study included 510 drug abstainers released from T Center, including 153 in the experimental group and 357 in the control group.Measurements: Demographic information, history of drug abuse, and motivation for drug rehabilitation (SOCRATES) were collected 1 month prior to drug abstainer release from compulsory detoxification. Then, the relapse situation after their release was tracked according to fixed time points.Findings: The overall relapse rate of 510 drug abstainers after their release from compulsory detoxification was 47.6%. The average survival time to relapse based on survival analysis was 220 days (N = 486), as calculated with Bayesian estimation by the MCMC method. The average survival times to relapse of the experimental group and control group were 393 and 175 days, respectively. By taking the specific survival time as the dependent variable and the group as the control variable (OR = 25.362), logistic regression analysis showed that marital status (OR = 2.666), previous compulsory detoxification experience (OR = 2.329) and location of household registration (OR = 1.557) had a significant impact on the survival time to relapse.Conclusions: The occurrence of relapse among drug patients released from compulsory detoxification can be delayed effectively through the intervention of professional social worker services. Regardless of whether patients receive aftercare after compulsory detoxification, drug-using patients who are single, have multiple detoxification experiences and whose households are registered in other provinces deserve special attention. Relevant suggestions to avoid relapse are provided.",
		"Repayment failures of borrowers have greatly affected the sustainable development of the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry. The latest literature reveals that existing risk evaluation systems may ignore important signals and risk factors affecting P2P repayment. In our study, we applied four machine learning methods (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBT), gradient boosting model (GBM), and neural network (NN)) to predict important factors affecting repayment by utilizing data from Renrendai.com in China from Thursday, January 1, 2015, to Tuesday, June 30, 2015. The results showed that borrowers who have passed video, mobile phone, job, residence or education level verification are more likely to default on loan repayment, whereas those who have passed identity and asset certification are less likely to default on loans. The accuracy and kappa value of the four methods all exceed 90%, and RF is superior to the other classification models. Our findings demonstrate important techniques for borrower screening by P2P companies and risk regulation by regulatory agencies. Our methodology and findings will help regulators, banks and creditors combat current financial disasters caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by addressing various financial risks and translating credit scoring improvements.",
		"There is a lack of quantitative studies on the acceptance of extramarital sex in China. Based on data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2013 (CGSS2013), this paper used a zero-inflated Poisson regression model to analyze the factors influencing the public’s attitudes toward extramarital sex. When other variables were controlled, groups of younger ages, higher educational levels, and stronger tendencies toward “liberalization” and non-Islamic beliefs were more tolerant toward extramarital sex, whereas gender and Christian beliefs had no significant influence. In this regard, family and marriage counseling, and society’s moral tolerance and social control of religion are discussed, and further research on cross-cultural verification is needed.",
		"COVID-19 is a huge catastrophe of global proportions, and this catastrophe has had far-reaching effects on energy production worldwide. In this paper, we build traditional statistical models and machine learning models to forecast energy production series in the post-pandemic period based on Chinese energy production data and COVID-19 Chinese epidemic data from 2018 to 2021. The experimental results showed that the optimal models in this study outperformed the baseline models on each series, with MAPE values less than 10. Further studies found that the LightGBM, NNAT and LSTM machine learning models worked better in unstable energy series, while the ARIMA statistical model still had an advantage in stable energy time series. Overall, the machine learning models outperformed the traditional models during COVID-19 in terms of prediction. Our findings provide an important reference for energy research in public health emergencies, as well as a theoretical basis for factories to adjust their production plans and governments to adjust their energy decisions during COVID-19.",
		"Background: The tripartite model suggests that although anxiety and depression have high co-morbidity and common risk factors, they represent theoretically distinct disease entities. However, whether they represent theoretically distinct disease entities or are just characteristics of a single negative affect dimension remains debated. This study used the latent profile analysis (LPA) approach to explore the symptom patterns of depression and anxiety among Chinese teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A sample of 6121 teacher participants from a district unit in southern China was used for analysis. The LPA was used to identify different symptom patterns of depression and anxiety. We subsequently used multinomial logistic regression to analyse the effects of demographic variables on the different profiles. Finally, the BCH method was used to assess the relationships between each profile and fear of COVID-19 and suicidal ideation.Results: The study identified five significant latent profiles of anxiety and depression and identified two subtypes (high anxiety subtype and high depression subtype) in the moderate psychological disorder group (MPDG). Regarding the differences in demographic information across profiles, we found that gender, professional title and age significantly influenced the distribution of the profiles. The risk for both fear of COVID-19 and suicidal ideation was highest in the severe psychological disorder group(SPDG). The high anxiety subtype had a significantly greater fear of the new coronavirus epidemic than the high depression subtype, which in turn had a significantly higher level of suicidal ideation than the high anxiety subtype. Limitations: The lack of baseline data before the outbreak made it difficult to understand the causal relationship between COVID-19 and the latent profile. The study sample was a group of teachers and may not be representative of the general population in China. Conclusion: This might be the first latent profile analysis of anxiety and depression co-morbidities among primary and secondary school teachers in China. The profiles we identified have distinct features that confirm their unique patterns of symptom endorsement. Our study may have important implications for early warning and intervention in teacher mental health.",
		"Background: In recent years, depression and anxiety have become increasingly common in Chinese primary and secondary school teachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) has received much attention for its good psychometric properties, but its psychometric properties and measurement invariance (MI) are still unknown in the teacher population. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the DASS-21 and its MI across subgroups in a representative sample of primary and secondary school teachers.Methods: A total of 6121 teachers were included in the final sample (81.2% female). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the WLSMV estimator was used to determine the best of the four competing models. We first calculated correlations between the DASS-21 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Trait Anger Scale (TAS), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess the construct validity, and then we determined the internal consistency by calculating Cronbach's alpha and average interitem correlations. Finally, we tested the MI of the optimal model across genders, age groups and professional titles and compared differences across subgroups.Results: The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha>0.8) and construct validity of the DASS-21 were excellent. In addition, the strict invariance of the bifactor model was established across subgroups. Some significant results also emerged from the tests of difference across subgroups. Limitations: The study was self-reported and may have been subject to social desirability bias. The links between the various DASS-21 items remain unclear. Finally, longitudinal MI was not tested. Conclusion: The Chinese version of the DASS-21 is a reliable, valid and convenient tool. It can be used in the rapid screening of teachers' mental health."],
